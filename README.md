# Roxy-Dots

in case anyone ever sees this: 

  I have written (almost) none of these configs from scratch. i have taken more talented peoples work and simply edited it to fit my favorite anime character. i will not name any of those projects i have edited because frankly i cant be asked to      look for all of them again.

  the install script is only meant for an archinstall hyprland sddm profile because im only ever going to use it in that way.
  seriously dont run the script on an already configured machine its made by a joker
  
  if you really crave the roxy rice so bad just install dependancies and configs manually

install script for install script:

    git clone https://github.com/InfidelDeving/Roxy-Dots/
    cd Roxy-Dots
    sh install.sh
