# Roxy-Dots

in case anyone ever sees this: 

  This is primarily meant for my use so the script installs programs you will probably not use.

  I have written (almost) none of these configs from scratch. i have taken more talented peoples work and simply edited it to fit my favorite anime character. i will not name any of those projects i have edited because frankly i cant be asked to      look for all of them again.

install it on a archinstall hyprland sddm profile (install script doesnt even work yet lmao)

install:

    git clone https://github.com/InfidelDeving/Roxy-Dots/
    cd Roxy-Dots
    sh install.sh
